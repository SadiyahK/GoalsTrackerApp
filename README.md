# Goals Tracker App

A simple react-native app that is multiplatform for logging and keeping track of a user's goals.
The focus of this project is to teach myself React Native and basic app development skills. 

# Features Of The App 

In the initial prototype of the app, the fetures I am aiming to achieve are:
    -The user can create an account using a secure sign in process.
    -The user can add and remove goals that they wish to keep track of.
    -The user can add daily/weekly logs of the progress they have made towards a particular goal.
    -The user can add milestones to a goal.
